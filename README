This is a standalone implementation of fortify source.  The implementation
is libc-agnostic and simply overlays the system headers by using
#include_next magic.

The implementation will trap only non-conformant programs.  This in turn
implies that fortify source level 2 protection is handled in the same way
as level 1.
